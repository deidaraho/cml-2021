    "* that we as data scientists (or in some cases algorithms or programs) select or create\n",
    "* specifically for the purpose of capturing key information that will inform our model or goal\n",
    "* may be related to one or more fields in a data set\n",
    "* may involve a change of represenatation from the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customer last name is a field in some records. Is it a feature? I.e., would we likely include it for its informational or predictive value about some business project? Probably not.\n",
    "* Customer phone number is a field. Might it be a feature?\n",
    "  * Area code and/or exchange (prefix) used to be geographically correlated ... so maybe ... especially if we are talking land lines only\n",
    "  * On the other hand, the last 4 digits are rarely meaningful\n",
    "  * For cell numbers, there might be some valuable info in the area code and exchange, but it's hard to know -- we might want to formulate an experiment to decide\n",
    "* Customer age might be a field in some data. Is it a feature?\n",
    "  * For some use cases, it might be extremely informative\n",
    "  * For other use cases, it might be flat out illegal to use\n",
    "* Suppose age is informative and legal for our project. But suppose that the exact age (26 vs. 27, say, or 53 vs. 55) is not terribly useful.\n",
    "  * We might transform the raw age *field* into a discrete feature.\n",
    "  * For example, we might group 0-17 as minors, 18-34 as young adult, 35-55 as middle age, etc.\n",
    "  * This pattern is called \"bucketing\" because we group values into a smaller number of buckets (which stand in for groups of raw values)\n",
    "  * This throws away some data but might make our model simpler or more accurate\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are many such patterns for extracting, transforming, and selecting features from a dataset for further use. There is no one right way to do it, and many machine learning experts have asserted that data and feature preparation is substantially *more* important to the end result than fancy mathematical algorithms."
